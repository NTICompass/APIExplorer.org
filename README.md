OpenFEMA API Explorer
=====================

My job at creating an API Explorer for OpenFEMA for #hackforchange.  http://hackforchange.org/challenges/interactive-api-explorer/

This created at the National Day of Civic Hacking hackathon at RIT.

I used the CodeIgniter framework for the backend and Twitter Bootstrap for the frontend.
