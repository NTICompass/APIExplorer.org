OpenFEMA API Explorer
=====================

My job at creating an API Explorer for OpenFEMA for #hackforchange.  http://hackforchange.org/challenges/interactive-api-explorer/

This created at the National Day of Civic Hacking hackathon at RIT.

I used the CodeIgniter framework for the backend and Twitter Bootstrap for the frontend.  To help me from killing FEMA's servers, I use PHP's APC to cache some of the API calls.  The frontend also uses jQuery, underscore.js, and some other scripts I found when Googling around.

The FEMA API docs are located here: http://www.fema.gov/openfema-api-documentation

I have a live demo of this program running at http://apiexplorer.org/OpenFEMA/ (SSL version coming soon).  Please don't kill my server's bandwitdh, kthxbai :-)
